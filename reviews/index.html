              <p>Mike took my wife, Tracey and I on a tour around KL and Batu Caves. We had a fantastic time and just loved his friendly personality!</p>

              <p>We enjoyed our trip to Kuala Lumpur very, very much and part of that was the nice trip we had with Mike. We would love to visit Kuala Lumpur again (my husband and I are very fond of the city) and Malaysia!</p>

              <p>Thank you for your great service back in August and for taking us out to the Kuala Gandah elephants and to see the Sunbear and the very unforgettable Silverleaf Monkeys. I am so thankful to have you take us out to see these special things. My husband Daniel very much enjoyed speaking with you. We loved our time in Malaysia and hope to return.</p>
