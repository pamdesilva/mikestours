					<p class="introtext2">My name is Michael and I love meeting people from all corners of the world and showcasing the wonders of KL and beyond. I enjoy it so much that I've been doing it for the past 20 years.</p>
					<p class="introtext2">Trips with me are not only fun, they're also filled with information and interesting facts. For a truly immersive experience, I find it important to provide my guests with historical backgrounds and intertwine fascinating stories about places we visit and things we come across during our adventures.</p>
					<p class="introtext2">I look forward to leaving you with an unforgettable experience.</p>

							<p>Thank you for your great service back and for taking us out to the Kuala Gandah elephants and to see the Sunbear and the very unforgettable Silverleaf Monkeys. I am so thankful to have you take us out to see these special things. My husband Daniel very much enjoyed speaking with you. We loved our time in Malaysia and hope to return.</p>
